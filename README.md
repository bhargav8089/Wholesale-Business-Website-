Wholesale Business Website
This repository contains the implementation of a simple, fully functional website for a wholesale business. The website integrates various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and construct a website for a wholesale business. The website utilizes a database created in a previous project, which includes tables for customers, agents, products, and orders. The main focus of the project is on PHP, but it also integrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.

Functionality
The website consists of several pages that provide different functionalities:

Product Search Page: This page allows users to search for products based on various parameters such as product name, warehouse city, quantity, and price. The search results are displayed on the Search Results page.

Search Results Page: This page displays the search results based on the parameters entered on the Product Search page. The results are filtered based on the specified criteria.

In addition to the minimum requirements, you have the freedom to include other pages in your website based on your preferences and available time. Some suggested pages include a landing page with company information and navigation links, a contact information page, and pages for managing customers, agents, products, and orders.
